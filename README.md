  DESCRIPTION:
 To create a responsive webpage that dynamically loads and displays data from a public API (such as weather or news), I'll walk you through the full process with a weather API example. We'll make the webpage interactive and responsive using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a structured approach to fulfill the deliverables.
 This project focuses on creating a webpage that can retrieve and display dynamic data from a public API, specifically for weather information. The goal is to allow users to input a location (such as a city name) and receive real-time weather updates, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, all fetched from a publicly available weather API.The webpage will be interactive, with a simple, intuitive interface, and will dynamically update the content based on the userâ€™s input.The core of the webpage is to integrate a public API that provides weather data. A popular choice for such an API is OpenWeatherMap, but there are many others like WeatherAPI, AccuWeather, and Weatherstack.The API will supply the necessary data based on the user's input (such as a city name or geographical coordinates) in JSON format.The webpage will request weather data from the API every time a user interacts with the page (e.g., enters a city name and clicks a button).
Upon receiving the data, the page will dynamically update to show weather details without requiring a full page reload.The user will enter a city name or location in an input field, and upon clicking a button, the weather data for that location will be fetched from the API and displayed.The webpage will be mobile-friendly, ensuring it is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
